## HW4 FAQ

* Q1 imputes the `icu_cohort.rds` data we compiled in HW3.

* Q2 uses the averaged imputed data sets from Q1.

* miceRanger takes forever. Tip by Benson Wu (@benson-wu): use `max.depth=10` reduces the runtime significantly. <https://github.com/FarrellDay/miceRanger/issues/6>

* How to identify outliers (extreme values)? Refer to normal range, or use values in a percentile range say 5% to 95%, or 1.5IQR rule. Document you choice, and explain this step needs consultancy with data providers. 

* How to average imputed categorical variables? Convert to numeric matrices (`model.matrix`) and average.

* Course project: MIMIC-IV.

* Make your GitHub repo `biostat-203b-2021-winter` public (after Mar 21) and show your work to back your resume. Feel free to modify the reports even after this course. You can make your GitHub repository into a webpage by using GitHub Pages.    

* **Use** these tools in your daily work: use Git/GitHub for all your homework and research projects, write weekly research report using RMarkdown, give presentation using ggplot2 and Shiny, write blog/tutorial, ...

## What's not covered

- Machine/statistical learning methods. Familiar with methods in [_Elements of Statistical Learning_](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) and software, e.g., _scikit-learn_.

  For non-statistician/biostatistician, I recommend [_An Introduction to Statistical Learning: With Applications in R_](https://ucla.on.worldcat.org/external-search?queryString=An%20Introduction%20to%20Statistical%20Learning#/oclc/852254203), which is less technical and more application focused.  

- Computational algorithms. Spring quarter's Biostat 257 will cover numerical linear algebra and numerical optimization algorithms. 

- Public health applications.

- Be open to languages. **Python** is a more generic programming language and widely adopted in data science. **JavaScript** is dominant in web applications. **Scala** is popular for implementing distributed programs. **Julia** is attractive for high performance scientific computing.
