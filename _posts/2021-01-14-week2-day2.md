## HW1

* Complete CITI (Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative) Training <https://physionet.org/about/citi-course/>. Choose `Log in using my institution`. Once log in, choose `Affiliate With Another Institution` -> `Massachusetts Institute of Technology Affiliates`. It's fine to put in any "affiliate email". The course title is `Data or Specimens Only Research`. 

  If you have completed similar modules for other training, submit certificate or screenshots. Still need to complete other CITI modules, which you have not taken before.
  
* PhysioNet credential application. Input me as the "supervisor".
