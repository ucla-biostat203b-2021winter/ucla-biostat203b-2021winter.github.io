* CITI training missing. Need links to completion report and completion certificate.

* Many of your did a great job counting occurrences of characters (multiple occurrences in same line, multiple spellings) in Pride and Prejudice. 

* `zcat filename | wc -l` vs `wc -l filename`.

* Be judicious what to put in git.

## Today
